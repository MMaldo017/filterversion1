Goal: Filter and serach a list of products rendered into <div class = "products"> in filter.html

This Js selects specific HTML elements, listens for user input (search, category,price),
and updats the DOM so the CSS in filter.css styles everything automatically

Our data array in .js file started with no DOM access
